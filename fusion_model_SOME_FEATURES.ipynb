      "**Justification:**\n",
      "The low estimated readmission probability is reasonable given the patient's relatively mild SOFA score of 0 and APS III of 54, which indicate a lower severity level compared to similar cases. Additionally, the Elixhauser comorbidity score of 12 suggests that the patient has multiple chronic conditions but they are well-managed at present. The patient improved significantly during her ICU stay, transitioning from BiPAP to nasal cannula by day 4 and being discharged home on day 7 with home oxygen therapy. Comparatively, the top 3 most similar historical cases had no readmissions within 30 days, supporting the low risk assessment.\n",
